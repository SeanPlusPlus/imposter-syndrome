I want to generate a fun, engaging podcast episode that reviews my original science fiction story, Trajectory. The podcast should feel like a blend of an in-depth book review, a sci-fi discussion, and a bit of a fun debate among hosts.

Here are some key points to cover:

1. Introduction (Hook the Audience)
A snappy opening that sets up Trajectory as a thrilling, character-driven survival story.
A quick summary of the plot (without giving everything away too soon).
The podcast hosts introduce themselves—maybe one is a hardcore sci-fi fan, one is skeptical of space survival stories, and one is a “Larry David-style cynic” who loves the humor in the book.
2. Setting the Stage
A deep dive into the worldbuilding—discuss the planet Elias crashes on (size, atmosphere, gravity, desert terrain, etc.).
How does Trajectory compare to other sci-fi survival stories like The Martian or Interstellar?
The hosts debate whether they would survive on this planet or die in the first five minutes.
3. Characters & Dynamics
Elias: His strengths, flaws, and how he handles survival.
TERI (the sarcastic drone): Why is a snarky AI the best thing in sci-fi? What are some of the best lines?
Lina’s big decision: Should she have risked her life to save Elias? Is she the real hero?
Discussion on the best character moments and biggest surprises in the story.
4. Science vs. Speculation
What parts of the book are grounded in real science, and what parts are pure fiction?
Could an atmosphere that thick really exist? Would those mysterious berries really work?
The hosts debate the most believable and wildest aspects of Trajectory.
5. The Ending & Future Speculation
How satisfying was the ending?
What does it mean that they have to start terraforming immediately?
Should there be a sequel? What would a Trajectory 2 look like?
Fun fan theories—like, what if TERI secretly knew more than he was letting on?
6. Rapid-Fire Fun Round
Best moment in the book?
If you could change one thing, what would it be?
Cast the movie version! (Who plays Elias, Lina, and TERI’s voice?)
What’s the wildest way this could have ended instead?
7. Sign-Off & Final Thoughts
Would they recommend the book?
One-sentence reviews from each host.
A fun send-off—maybe TERI gets the last word.
