The moment the thrusters died, Captain Elias Vance knew he was no longer flying the Icarus. He was falling.

The asteroid came out of nowhere—small, fast, a fragment of some ancient collision. The impact wasn’t a direct hit, but it was enough. It sheared through the port stabilizers, tore open two fuel lines, and sent him into a slow, sickening tumble. The engines flickered, sputtered, then died completely.

Cruel fate. Nothing more. He hadn’t been reckless. He hadn’t miscalculated. He’d done everything right, and still, here he was—locked in motion, drifting forward at an unchangeable trajectory.

The nav screen updated, and his stomach twisted.

Ahead—directly in his path—was Ark-12, the colony ship. Five thousand souls, frozen in their pods, waiting to wake up in a new world. His velocity wasn’t high enough to obliterate them on impact, but it was enough to rupture the hull. A glancing hit would be a disaster; a direct one would be extinction.

He checked, rechecked, ran the numbers again. No way out.

Unless—

A flashing yellow indicator caught his eye. RESERVE MANEUVERING FUEL: 2% REMAINING.

His breath caught.

He still had one burn left. A last chance.

He reached for his stylus, then hesitated. No. This wasn’t something he could leave to the ship’s failing nav system. He unclipped his notepad, flipped to a blank page, and started scribbling.

Thrust angle. Relative momentum. Escape corridor.

His hand worked fast, numbers spilling across the paper, fueled by a desperate, impossible hope. He blocked out everything else—the alarms, the faint crackling of dying systems, even the rising panic clawing at his throat. This was pure physics. Just forces and motion.

He started with his current trajectory—velocity vector, relative drift, impact time. The Icarus was already in motion, locked on course, a bullet with no guidance. His only tool was his maneuvering thruster, and the question wasn’t whether he could avoid Ark-12—it was how far he could push himself before he ran dry.

He scribbled a quick equation, solving for delta-V. ΔV = Isp × g₀ × ln(m₀/m₁). His specific impulse was garbage—these weren’t main engines, just emergency jets meant for minor course corrections. He estimated burn efficiency, ran a back-of-the-envelope calculation on fuel mass versus ship mass. 2% reserve fuel. Not enough to stop. Not enough to reverse.

But enough to nudge.

His pulse spiked. If he could change his trajectory by just a few degrees—just three, maybe even two—he could miss Ark-12. Avoid the impact completely. He scratched out a quick estimate of required thrust duration, recalculated the force needed to offset his current drift.

His chest heaved. That was it. That was his way out.

Then he checked his final trajectory.

He ran the numbers three times, just to be sure.

The pencil slowed in his grip.

Odyssey-4.

He stared at the figures, willing them to change. They didn’t. The thruster burn wouldn’t just move him away from Ark-12—it would push him toward the Odyssey-4. At his current velocity, he couldn’t simply “veer off into space.” He was moving too fast, and the change in vector would put him on a collision course with the research vessel.

Twenty people. Not asleep. Awake. Alive.

They wouldn’t have time to move. No escape, no last-second maneuver. The warning would come, and then—ten seconds. That’s all. Ten seconds before impact.

He thought of them. Thought of her. Lina.

His hands clenched into fists.

Pressing the button ignites the thrusters. Pressing the button saves five thousand. Pressing the button kills twenty.

Doing nothing kills more.

His breath shuddered. His fingers hovered over the ignition. If he fired, he would die. If he didn’t, he would die. The only difference was how many he took with him.

A tremor ran through his arm. He flexed his fingers, trying to stop the shaking. His body rejected the choice, his mind screaming for an answer that wasn’t there.

The Ark-12 loomed larger.

His throat tightened. His heart ached.

Ten seconds.

Nine.

Lina.

Eight.

His hand wouldn’t move.

Seven.

He was still hoping for a way out.

Six.

There wasn’t one.

Five.

Pressing the button ignites the thrusters.

Four.

Pressing the button saves five thousand.

Three.

Pressing the button kills twenty.

Two.

Doing nothing kills more.

One.

Elias pressed the button.

Elias had made his choice.

Through the viewport, the Odyssey-4 loomed ahead, its dark hull catching the faint glow of the system’s distant star. The numbers were final. The trajectory was locked. There was no undoing this.

Inside, behind reinforced glass, he saw them. Small figures. Shadows against the light. Someone was at the window, staring up at him. Others gathered behind them, unmoving. Watching.

Elias swallowed hard. Ten seconds.

Nine.

His fingers dug into the armrests.

Eight.

His body was frozen, but his mind was screaming—This is it.

Seven.

Then—something shifted. A flicker on the nav screen. A tiny drift.

Six.

His stomach flipped. The numbers—his perfect, brutal numbers—were off.

Five.

His gut told him before the instruments confirmed it. The Icarus wasn’t holding course. It was veering.

Four.

The viewport window, the figures, the Odyssey-4—they were sliding away.

Three.

His eyes snapped to the telemetry, his brain shifting into high gear.

Two.

Thrust asymmetry. The burn had been off.

One.

He wasn’t going to hit the Odyssey-4.

He was going to miss.

Elias sucked in a breath, heart pounding as he scanned the data. The burn had fired unevenly—just enough for the ship to yaw slightly, throwing him off course. He should have expected it. The asteroid strike had already compromised the hull, and his stabilizers had been barely holding together. When he fired the last thrust, the force hadn’t distributed evenly.

The result? He was still accelerating. Still doomed. But now his target had changed.

The planet.

His fingers flew over the console. The Icarus had veered, but its vector was still locked—only now, instead of slamming into the Odyssey-4, he was falling toward the massive world below.

Not a slow descent. Not an orbit.

A full-speed atmospheric entry.

Elias swore under his breath.

This planet wasn’t ready for human settlement. It was barely past preliminary terraforming surveys. The Ark-12 colonists were supposed to arrive decades from now, after the surface had been made habitable. The only reason anyone was even orbiting it—the scientists, the military, the settlers in cryosleep—was to study it, not land on it.

And yet, here he was. Falling.

His hands clenched. This wasn’t survival. This was impact.

The hull creaked as the first thin wisps of atmosphere licked against the failing frame of the Icarus.

Elias gritted his teeth. He wasn’t dead yet.

Lina pressed her fingers into the damp soil, feeling the cool, rich earth between them. It was good soil. She had spent months perfecting the composition—adjusting nitrogen levels, oxygenation, the microbial balance—all inside a sealed, floating ecosystem orbiting a world that was supposed to become humanity’s next home.

She smiled to herself. Life always found a way.

The Odyssey-4’s hydroponic garden stretched out around her, an oasis of green amidst the cold metal and hum of ship systems. Tall stalks of grain swayed gently under the artificial breeze, their golden hues catching the simulated sunlight from the overhead UV panels. Rows of leafy vegetables—kale, lettuce, and deep purple spinach—stood neatly in nutrient trays. Beyond them, a cluster of fruit-bearing trees cast dappled shadows across the polished floors.

Lina exhaled, slow and steady. The scent of fresh basil clung to her fingertips.

For a moment, she let herself relax, rolling her shoulders, feeling the warmth of the greenhouse seep into her skin. The garden was hers. In a way, it felt like she had willed it into existence, made something alive in a place where life did not belong.

She pushed herself to her feet, brushing dirt from her jumpsuit. The soft light overhead caught the sharp angle of her jaw, the strength in her shoulders. Lina had never been delicate, never wanted to be. But she was lovely in the way storms were lovely—strong, steady, and full of quiet power.

She moved through the rows, letting her fingertips trail across soft leaves as her mind wandered.

Elias.

She wondered how he would react to the news.

Would he laugh? Would he panic? Would he just pull her close, press his forehead against hers the way he always did when words weren’t enough?

Her hand drifted to her stomach. It was still flat, still unchanged. But inside, something new had begun. A secret, fragile thing.

Life.

She exhaled again, this time slower. He should have been back by now.

A soft chime echoed through the greenhouse—a status alert. Something outside the ship had entered high-velocity approach. She barely registered it, too lost in thought.

She turned, stretching the ache from her lower back, and drifted toward the viewport. From here, she could see everything—the vast black of space, the swirl of the planet’s storm-thickened atmosphere, and the deep shadows cast by the other orbiting vessels.

Her gaze flicked toward the familiar shape of the Icarus.

Then—it moved.

A blink. A breath.

Lina's stomach dropped.

The Icarus wasn’t slowing down. It wasn’t docking.

It was falling.

Her hand pressed against the glass as she watched, heart hammering, breath catching in her throat. The ship should have stopped. It should have changed course. But instead, it slipped past the Odyssey-4 like a stone skipping off the edge of something vast, missing them by the thinnest of margins.

It was heading straight for the planet below.

Lina’s fingers curled against the glass.

She didn’t scream. She didn’t move. She just watched.

And then, she prayed.

Elias woke to the taste of blood.

He lay twisted in his harness, the straps digging into his ribs. The world was sideways. Smoke curled through the cracked cockpit, thick and acrid, clinging to his throat. Sparks spat from a dead console. His breath came ragged, shallow. His body ached, but he was alive.

He unclipped the harness. Pain flared through his chest as he dropped to the warped metal floor. He braced himself against the bulkhead, trying to focus. The viewport was shattered. Through it, he saw only gray. No sky. No horizon. Just ash.

The hatch was warped. He pressed his shoulder against it, gritting his teeth as metal groaned in protest. It took three hard shoves before the seal gave. The air hissed as pressure equalized, hot and dry against his face. He coughed, blinking against the thick gray dust swirling into the cabin. It clung to his skin, coated his tongue. He pulled himself through the opening, boots hitting unsteady ground.

The wind shifted. The ash began to clear.

And for the first time, he saw where he had landed.

The planet was massive. Bigger than Earth, but with gravity that felt familiar, close enough that walking wouldn’t be a struggle. Its atmosphere was thick, dense enough that sound carried in a way it shouldn’t have. The wind didn’t whisper—it pushed. The air wasn’t still—it wrapped around him, heavy and full of things unseen.

He inhaled carefully. Breathable. It wasn’t poisoned, wasn’t the choking death some planets offered. But it tasted different—dry, cool, something his body didn’t quite recognize. He let it settle in his lungs. 

Most of the surface was desert, just like this—vast, endless plains of fine dust and shifting dunes. But there were other places. Places the orbital surveys had mapped, places where the cloud cover broke just enough to show deep canyons, dense pockets of green, large bodies of water that had been marked but never explored. No human had ever set foot here. Only machines. Hardened drones, sent down in controlled drops to collect data, to test soil, to scan the depths.

And yet, here he was.

The sky overhead was nothing like Earth’s. Too thick. Too heavy. There was no clear blue, no sun breaking through—just endless shifting layers of cloud and dust, a sky that churned and hid what lay beyond.

Elias stood in the wreckage of his ship, boots sinking slightly into the alien dust. He exhaled, slow and steady, staring out at the vastness before him.

He had survived the fall.

Now he had to survive the rest of it.

His boots sank slightly into the powdery sand, a fine layer of ash and dust shifting beneath him. The bruises on his ribs flared with pain as he straightened. Nothing broken. Lucky.

The world around him was endless and empty. Sand and rock, stretching in every direction. Pale cliffs loomed in the far distance, barely visible through the haze, but there was nothing else. No plants. No movement. No life.

Except—

He squinted. Three hundred meters out, something gleamed in the dull light.

A wreck.

It was old. The hull was battered, half-buried in the sand, its once-sleek plating pitted and scarred. It wasn’t a ship, not a full-sized one. A drone lander, maybe? Sent down for reconnaissance, for mapping, for science. If it was here, that meant the ship carrying it never made it back.

He exhaled, slow and steady. He was lucky.

His own wreck was in bad shape, but he hadn’t needed to worry about burning up on entry. The Icarus had barely held together, but it had done its job.

Not that it mattered now.

He turned back to his ship, assessing the damage. The cockpit was crushed inward, the thrusters were dead, the undercarriage was half-buried in sand. Nothing to salvage. He hadn’t packed survival gear. He was supposed to be out for a few hours of orbital recon, not making an emergency landing on an uncharted world.

All he had was his flight suit.

And one bottle of water.

Elias sighed, rolled his shoulders, and started walking.

The trek to the wreck was slow. The sand shifted unpredictably beneath him—soft in some places, packed hard in others. The wind was steady, not violent, but it never stopped. It curled around his ears, caught in the folds of his suit, carried the scent of something dry, something ancient.

He reached the wreck and circled it once. The lander was split down one side, hull plating peeled back like something had tried to claw its way out. The insignia on its side was half-scraped away, but he could still make out the faded letters of the survey program.

He braced his hands against the warped hull and shoved against the outer hatch.

Nothing.

He tried again.

Still nothing.

He stepped back, scanned the wreck again. A secondary access panel. He crouched, fingers brushing away sand, finding the manual override. It was stiff, nearly fused shut, but after a few forceful yanks, the hatch gave way with a sharp metallic groan.

Something inside hummed to life.

Elias froze.

A soft whirring. Then a click-click-click—like servos cycling up after a long sleep.

Lights flickered inside.

Then, something moved.

He barely had time to step back before a small, hovering droid popped out of the wreckage. Dark metal chassis, spherical central body, two thin stabilizing arms. It adjusted mid-air, then fixed a glowing blue eye directly on him.

Silence.

Then, in a flat but unmistakably annoyed voice—

"What the hell are you doing here?"

The droid hovered in place, its single glowing eye fixed on Elias.

Stamped on its worn metal frame, barely visible beneath years of dust and corrosion, was a designation:

T.E.R.I.
Tactical Exploration and Reconnaissance Intelligence.

TERI.

It adjusted its altitude slightly, as if studying him. Then, in a voice that sounded entirely too irritated for a machine, it said:

“Okay. Let’s just go over this one more time. You’re a human. On this planet. Breathing.”

Elias rubbed his temple. “Yeah. We covered that.”

“No, no, no. You don’t understand.” TERI floated a little closer, as if squinting at him. “This planet is still in recon phase. Meaning no humans. Meaning not you. And—this is a big one—it is supposed to be unapproachable due to extreme atmospheric entry conditions. So tell me…” The droid tilted slightly. “How. The hell. Are you here?”

Elias exhaled. “I was flying a recon mission. Standard orbital pass. Nothing crazy. Then I hit some debris, lost thrusters, and before I knew it—” He gestured to the wreckage of the Icarus. “Here I am.”

TERI made a noise—something between a mechanical tsk and a whir.

“Wow. That’s bad luck.”

Elias smirked. “Thanks.”

“Oh no, I mean it. You are, quite literally, not supposed to be alive. I’ve seen the entry models. Your ship should’ve crumpled like a beer can before it even touched atmosphere.”

Elias sighed. “Yeah. I got that part.”

TERI floated in a slow, thoughtful circle. “Okay, well. You’re here. And you’re somehow not a human puddle. So let’s talk about getting you off this death rock.”

“That’s the idea,” Elias said. “Can you send a signal up to the Ark-12 or Odyssey-4? Let them know where I am?”

TERI’s eye flickered as it ran a scan. A few seconds later, the droid let out a sharp electronic sigh. “Oh. Wow. Just when I thought things couldn’t get worse.”

Elias clenched his jaw. “What.”

TERI spun around dramatically. “You’re gonna love this—neither of these wrecks have a functioning transponder.”

Elias’s stomach dropped. “Come on. There’s got to be something we can use.”

TERI gave an exaggerated pause, as if humoring him. “Nope. Sorry. We’re completely, totally, screwed.”

Elias ran a hand through his hair. “Okay. Okay. Let’s think. You’re reconnaissance, right? You must have a map of the other drone landings.”

TERI hesitated, then begrudgingly admitted, “Yeah. I do.”

“Anything nearby that might still have a working signal?”

Another pause. Then, TERI’s eye pulsed as it processed the request.

“Well, well, well,” the droid finally said. “Looks like we might not die here after all. There’s a drone lander about forty-two miles from here. If it’s intact, its comms relay should still be active.”

Elias let out a breath. “Great. So we head there.”

“Ah. One problem.”

Elias braced himself. “Of course.”

TERI drifted in a slow circle around him, like a shark waiting to deliver bad news. “You have, what? Half a liter of water?”

Elias pulled the bottle from his flight suit. A single, lukewarm bottle.

TERI whistled. “Yeah. That’s… not gonna cut it.”

Elias looked at the endless desert stretching ahead. Sand. Rock. Nothing. “What are the odds of finding water on the way?”

“Actually,” TERI said, “I might have something for you.” Its eye flickered, running another scan. “Looks like there’s a potential water source about ten miles in. No guarantees, but it’s the best shot you’ve got.”

Elias nodded. Forty miles. With injuries. On foot.

TERI made a thoughtful buzzing noise. “Sooo… just to recap: We are stranded, I might die of thirst, and our only hope is to make a horrific death march across a landscape basically designed to kill all life.”

Elias capped the bottle and slid it back into his suit. “Sounds about right.”

TERI hovered beside him. “You are remarkably calm for someone in your position.”

Elias adjusted the straps on his flight suit. “It’s either that or freak out. And that won’t help.”

TERI paused. Then, with a small tilt of its frame, it said, “Okay, Matt Damon. Let’s go for a walk.”

Elias huffed a laugh, took a step forward. Then another.

And together, they started across the wasteland.

The conference room aboard Odyssey-4 was silent except for the hum of the ship’s life support systems. The overhead lights were dimmed, casting long shadows over the faces gathered around the central table. The holo-display flickered with grainy data—telemetry logs, atmospheric readings, and one jagged trajectory line plunging straight into the planet below.

Lina stood with her arms crossed, jaw clenched, eyes locked on the screen.

“No beacon. No comms. No signal.” Dr. Vaughn, the ship’s lead astrophysicist, exhaled heavily. He swiped at the display, magnifying the last known coordinates. “All we have is an approximation of where he went down. And even that’s… generous.”

Commander Nguyen, the mission’s operations lead, leaned forward, fingers steepled. “We need to be realistic. Given the impact velocity, the atmospheric conditions, and the fact that this planet is still in the recon phase—” he let the silence hang. “—Elias is likely dead.”

Lina’s eyes snapped to him. “You don’t know that.”

Nguyen sighed. “We lost his signal almost immediately after entry. You saw the models. The odds of his ship holding together were—”

“I don’t care about the odds.”

The room tensed.

Lina placed her hands on the table and leaned in. “We’re not just leaving him down there.”

Dr. Sorenson, the ship’s exobiologist, ran a hand through her hair. “Lina, I get it, I do. But we don’t even know where to start. Even if he somehow survived, we have no way of pinpointing his location. He could be anywhere in a two-hundred-mile radius.”

“Then we look,” Lina shot back. “We have survey drones. Atmospheric landers. Equipment specifically designed for—”

“For reconnaissance,” Nguyen interrupted. “Not rescue.”

The table fell silent again.

Sorenson hesitated before speaking. “If we sent a manned mission down, the risk would be enormous. We barely have enough data to model stable entry. The turbulence alone—”

“I volunteer.” Lina said it without hesitation.

A few heads turned in shock.

Nguyen sighed. “That’s not going to happen.”

“Why not?”

“Because if Elias didn’t make it, we’re not losing anyone else.”

Lina’s jaw tightened. She stared at the holo-display again, at the dead telemetry, at the last flicker of his ship before it vanished. No. He wasn’t gone. He couldn’t be.

“We’re sending down a drone,” Nguyen said. “That’s as far as this goes.”

Lina’s fingers curled against the table, but she said nothing.

Sorenson glanced at her, then back at Nguyen. “And if it finds something?”

Nguyen exhaled. “Then we’ll talk.”

Lina nodded, but inside, she already knew the truth.

If the drone found nothing, she wasn’t going to stop there.

She would find him.

One way or another.

Elias stumbled, his knees nearly buckling.

The heat was relentless. The weight of his own body felt unbearable. Every step was a conscious effort, every breath an argument against collapse. His vision blurred, his head light, his limbs sluggish.

He wasn’t going to make it.

The thought had been whispering at him for miles, but now it was screaming. He was done. His legs locked mid-step, his body swayed—

And then, beneath the dry wind, he heard it.

Water.

He forced his head up. TERI had already stopped ahead, hovering motionless.

“Would you look at that,” the droid muttered.

The ground sloped downward, and at the bottom, a stream wound its way through the dusty landscape—thin, but unmistakably real. Rippling, shimmering, impossible.

Elias didn’t think. He moved.

He practically fell down the slope, skidding on loose rock, his battered boots hitting the water’s edge. His hands hit the surface, and he drank.

The first swallow was like fire down his throat. The second, colder. By the third, he could breathe again.

He exhaled, slumping forward onto his elbows, the coolness of the stream soaking into his sleeves.

TERI hovered just above him, skeptical. “You don’t even want to, I don’t know, test that first?”

Elias wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Too late.”

TERI made a grumbling noise but didn’t argue.

For the first time in hours, Elias felt… something close to human again.

And then he saw the berries.

Clusters of small, deep violet fruits grew low along the stream’s edge, tucked between curling alien grasses. The moment he saw them, his stomach tightened with hunger.

He reached for them without thinking.

“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” TERI said, zipping closer. “You cannot be serious.”

Elias plucked a few, rolling them in his palm. They were firm, their skin thin and smooth. He brought them closer. They smelled… good.

TERI sounded on the verge of a meltdown. “Okay, listen, I get it. You’re starving. But do you know how many things in the universe look totally edible and then liquefy your insides?”

Elias met the droid’s glowing eye. Then, deliberately, he popped a berry into his mouth.

TERI twitched midair. “Unbelievable.”

The berry burst on his tongue. A rush of flavor—sweet, tart, slightly earthy, with a kick of something almost citrus-like.

He swallowed.

Nothing bad happened.

Elias grinned, reaching for another handful.

TERI practically sputtered. “Are you—? You didn’t even—! You didn’t die so now you’re just doubling down?”

Elias ate another, and another.

Then, something shifted.

The exhaustion, the sluggishness, the haze in his brain—it all melted away.

His heartbeat steadied. His muscles relaxed. His thoughts cleared.

He felt… good.

Better than good. Stronger. Sharper. Like his body was tuning itself, recalibrating.

TERI, still floating at a cautious distance, tilted its head. “…Huh.”

Elias stretched his fingers, blinking at the rush of alertness washing over him. “I think,” he said, “I just found our next meal.”

TERI muttered something unintelligible. Then, after a long pause:

“…I’m logging this under bad decisions that somehow worked out.”

Elias smirked, grabbing another handful of berries.

They weren’t out of danger. Not even close.

But for the first time since crashing, he had energy.

And that meant he had a chance.

The wreckage loomed ahead, half-buried in the sand, its outer plating warped and scorched from a failed descent.

Elias felt his stomach tighten. If this thing couldn’t handle entry, what chance did an actual rescue have?

TERI hovered ahead, scanning the husk. “Well, this is a charming pile of garbage.”

Elias ran a hand along the bent hull, fingers tracing the faded mission markings. This lander had been here for years. A failed attempt. A silent monument to the dangers of this place.

But inside—

“Comms relay,” he muttered.

TERI was already on it, floating toward a half-collapsed panel. “If this thing’s even semi-functional, we might be able to bounce a signal up.”

Elias crouched beside the drone, pried the panel open, and was met with a mess of fried circuitry, loose cabling, and sand where sand definitely shouldn’t be.

TERI let out a mechanical sigh. “I’m gonna go ahead and not get our hopes up.”

Elias ignored it. He dug through the wreck, pulling aside debris, checking wiring, searching for something—anything—that could still work.

TERI hovered impatiently. “You know, the Odyssey-4 has much better equipment than whatever prehistoric junk—”

Elias yanked a data module free from the tangle of wires. The status light blinked faintly.

TERI stopped mid-sentence.

“…Okay, maybe there’s hope.”

Elias wasted no time. He reattached the module, rerouted the power from the emergency backup, and forced a manual initialization. The lander whined to life, lights flickering. The entire thing shuddered as if waking from a long coma.

Then—

A signal.

TERI’s eye flared. “Holy Moly.”

Elias swallowed. “We’re live?”

“Not just live.” TERI adjusted, running a quick scan. “We’re pinging Odyssey-4.”

Elias held his breath. Seconds crawled by.

Then—on the tiny, degraded screen of the lander’s ancient comms panel—

ACK

A single, simple acknowledgment.

Elias exhaled. His arms slumped against the console. He laughed, once. The kind of laugh that sounded too much like relief and fear mixed together.

“We did it,” he muttered.

TERI floated beside him, uncharacteristically quiet.

They’d reached the orbiting ships.

They weren’t alone.

But the problem wasn’t communication. The problem was…

What now?

Elias already knew what they were thinking up there. How? How the hell were they going to get him out of here?

A ship couldn’t just descend, scoop him up, and fly back out.

The turbulence, the entry conditions, the sheer instability of this planet’s atmosphere—it was a death trap.

Elias stared at the small, flickering signal readout. He could picture them in the Odyssey’s conference room right now. Studying the same data. Realizing the same impossible truth.

They had his signal.

But that didn’t mean they could save him.

The first drone was torn apart before it reached the lower atmosphere.

The second lasted six seconds longer.

The third made it farther than either of them, its reinforced hull pushing against the chaotic forces below. But in the end, it, too, was swallowed by the planet’s wrath—ripped into debris, another failure, another empty hope.

The Odyssey-4 command center was silent.

Lina sat rigid, hands clenched into fists. Around her, the room was filled with faces that had already accepted the inevitable.

“We can’t get to him.”

The words hit her like a weight to the chest.

She turned to Nguyen. His hands were pressed together, knuckles white. He wasn’t wrong. Three attempts, three failures.

“Maybe,” Dr. Sorenson started hesitantly, “maybe we try again in—”

“There is no later,” Lina snapped. Her voice echoed in the room.

Nguyen exhaled, shaking his head. “We’re out of options.”

Lina’s heartbeat pounded. No. No, they weren’t.

Her throat tightened. Her heart ached. 

Do nothing, and he's dead. Try and save him and both (no ... all three of them) would likely die.

It took Elias 10 seconds to make his impossible decision, it took Lina less than 1.

She broke into storage, grabbed a flight suit, and ran straight to the flight bay.

The Ark Nursery wasn’t built for this.

Its walls were reinforced for storage, not entry. It was meant to be a vessel for future life, not a lifeline for a doomed planetfall.

Rows of sealed soil beds lined the interior. Racks of seed pods hung in climate-controlled chambers. It was supposed to be years before any of this touched real ground.

But now?

Now it was her best—and only—shot.

Lina’s hands flew over the controls, overriding the ship’s locked flight protocols. Warnings flared across the screen. Severe atmospheric instability. Unsafe descent vector. Catastrophic entry risk.

She accepted them all.

In the last seconds before she punched ignition, she let out a slow breath. It wasn’t just her anymore.

Her hand dropped instinctively to her stomach.

Then she hit the throttle.

The descent.
The ship screamed downward.

The atmosphere punched against the hull, shaking the cockpit like a living thing trying to tear her apart. Lina gritted her teeth. Every alarm was blaring. Every warning light flashed.

She could barely see the nav screen through the turbulence.

A brief thought flickered in her mind. This is why they all failed. This is why they all died.

She didn’t care.

She forced the controls forward, wrestling the ship against the pull of gravity, guiding it not just downward, but toward Elias.

When she finally broke through the lowest cloud layer, the ground rose up too fast.

No time. No precision. No choice.

She braced.

The impact slammed her forward.

Metal shrieked. The world whited out.

100 meters away. Elias saw it happen.

The fireball, the impact, the skidding wreckage tearing across the desert toward them.

His chest seized. No, no, no.

TERI was already moving.

“Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god,” the droid was saying as it shot forward, blue glow flashing wildly. “She better not be dead, I swear to—”

Elias wasn’t listening.

He ran.

His legs burned, lungs heaving—but he ran.

The ship wasn’t destroyed. That was the only thought he let himself hold onto.

He reached the hatch seconds after TERI.

The panel was half-torn from the frame. Smoke curled from the undercarriage. The ship groaned as metal settled.

He found the release latch and yanked.

It didn’t budge.

Again.

Nothing.

Again—

The hatch burst open.

Elias staggered back as Lina pulled herself into view.

She was bruised. Bloodied. Breathing.

She looked at him. And she smiled.

Elias let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.

He laughed—shaky, disbelieving. Then he grabbed her, pulling her into a hug so tight it nearly crushed them both.

TERI hovered back slightly, still buzzing with panic.

“Oh my god. I thought you were dead,” Elias said.

Lina winced. “I feel dead.”

TERI floated into view, giving a long, drawn-out hmm. “Well, well, well,” the droid muttered. “Another brilliant human decision, defying logic and common sense to plummet into a death trap. Love it. Really. This is exactly what we needed. More humans crash-landing.”

Lina exhaled sharply, brushing the dirt from her suit.

Elias looked over her shoulder. The interior of the ship was chaos. Bags of soil had burst open, seeds scattered everywhere.

“…Well,” he said slowly, still catching his breath. “Guess the three of us will get started on the terraforming a bit early.”

Lina let out a tired laugh. “Yeah,” she said. “Looks like it.”

She pressed a hand to her ribs, wincing.

TERI tilted its head. “Sooo ... just throwing this out there, but uh—you got some bruised ribs, or are you, ya know ...”

The moment hung in the air.

Elias turned to Lina.

Lina looked at him.

"Guess the _four_ of us will get started on the terraforming a bit early."
