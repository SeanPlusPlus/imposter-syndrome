Jack's breath hitched, his gaze darting frantically between the approaching FBI agents and the shadowy figure in the van. Heart racing, instinct took over—he lunged forward and jumped inside. The van door slammed shut, plunging the interior into darkness.

He heard tires squeal as the vehicle accelerated sharply, throwing him off balance. Jack grasped wildly at anything to steady himself, gripping cold metal benches lining the van's interior. As his eyes adjusted to the dimness, the rough features of the man who had ordered him in became clear—hard eyes, stubbled face, a scar running jaggedly down his cheek.

"What the hell is going on?" Jack demanded, his voice shaking.

"Quiet," the man growled, leaning forward and staring into Jack’s eyes with unsettling intensity. "You know why we're here."

"I don't!" Jack insisted, his voice rising. "You've got the wrong guy! I'm just a developer—I'm nobody."

The scarred man snorted humorlessly. "Very funny, Mr. Hale. But playing dumb won't save you."

"I'm serious—I write code, that's it. Blockchain apps, sure, but just tinkering—"

The man's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Tinkering. Is that what you call moving one hundred million dollars in Bitcoin?"

Jack gaped, stunned. "One hundred million—what? Bitcoin? You've got the wrong guy!"

The van lurched around a corner, sending Jack sprawling onto the floor. His captor steadied himself easily, looming over Jack with grim menace. "Listen carefully," he said, his voice low, dangerous. "We need the seed phrase."

"Seed phrase? What are you talking about? I swear, I don’t know anything about that."

The scarred man studied him for a tense moment, his face unreadable. "We will find out soon enough," he said coldly.

Jack swallowed hard, a surge of nausea twisting his stomach. Fear mixed with confusion, reality blurring into nightmare. How had he—a law-abiding coder, someone who had tinge of mild panic when he jaywalked—ended up at the center of something like this?

The van sped through the city, heading deeper into the maze of streets. As buildings blurred past, Jack's mind raced frantically. Somehow, he had been mistaken for someone else—someone dangerous, someone with secrets worth one hundred million dollars.

He needed to figure this out, fast. And he had to convince them they'd grabbed the wrong man before it was too late.
