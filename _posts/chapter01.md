Jack Hale squinted at the dense wall of text on his screen, fingers hovering over his keyboard as the Los Angeles sun spilled harsh afternoon glare through his tiny office window. He sighed, rubbing his temples. It had been a grueling day debugging a stubborn API endpoint—his team's deadline looming ominously at midnight. Though Jack had carved his career through online boot camps and grit rather than a conventional computer science degree, he knew his way around code. Still, doubt whispered regularly, telling him he didn't quite belong.

The office, a refurbished warehouse in the Arts District, was mostly empty by seven PM. Jack stretched and leaned back, the sounds of distant downtown traffic humming gently outside. He felt his phone vibrate—a message from his friend, Carlos. "Trivia night at Angel City Brewery?" Jack started typing a reply when a shadow flickered in his peripheral vision.

Before he could turn around, the doors to the office slammed open. A group of dark-suited men flooded in, swift and silent. Jack spun, heart hammering. Instinctively, he pulled out his AirPods, suddenly aware he was sweating.

"Jack Hale?" A voice, sharp and cold, sliced through the quiet.

Jack slowly turned. Three figures stood there, dressed neatly in dark suits, stern expressions fixed beneath narrow-brimmed hats. "Yes?"

"You're coming with us," the man in front said, stepping forward, holding out a badge just long enough for Jack to glimpse the letters—FBI.

Jack's heart jolted. His throat tightened, mouth dry. "What's going on?"

"We have a few questions," said the lead agent, his voice clipped. "About your recent activities online."

"Activities?" Jack's voice cracked, confusion rapidly turning to panic. Had one of his personal projects triggered something by mistake?

Before he could protest further, his phone buzzed again—this time, insistently. The screen displayed an unknown number. Jack, impulsively, glanced down. The message was stark, brief:

"THEY'RE COMING FOR YOU. RUN."

He hesitated for a split second, heart racing. Then, without thinking, Jack lunged backward, knocking his chair over to create a barrier, bolting towards the stairwell that led down to the side exit. Behind him, the agents shouted, their footsteps heavy as they gave chase.

Jack hit the door hard, bursting into the cool evening air, his mind racing. Just as he stumbled onto Mateo Street, headlights blinded him momentarily. A black van screeched to a stop beside him. The door slid open, revealing another figure, equally imposing.

"Get in," the voice ordered, thick with a Russian accent, leaving no room for argument.

Jack froze, heartbeat pounding in his ears. Behind him, the agents rounded the corner. He had seconds to decide who he feared most.
