**Chapter 1: Unexpected Guests**

Jack Hale squinted at the dense wall of text on his screen, fingers hovering over his keyboard as the Los Angeles sun cast a warm, golden glow through the office's large windows, slightly ajar to let in the faint breeze and sounds of the city. He sighed, rubbing his temples. It had been a grueling day debugging a stubborn API endpoint—his team's deadline looming ominously at nine AM tomorrow.

The office, a refurbished warehouse in the Arts District, was empty by seven PM. Jack stretched and leaned back, taking in the gentle hum of distant downtown traffic. The fading sunlight bathed the room in soft amber hues, highlighting the industrial charm of exposed brick and wooden beams. He debated staying late to finish the task or reaching out to his girlfriend, Sarah. His phone vibrated—a message from Sarah popped up: "Trivia night at Angel City Brewery?" Jack hesitated, started typing a reply, when suddenly the doors to the office slammed open with a deafening crash.

A group of dark-suited men surged into the room, their movements precise and coordinated, exuding an unmistakable air of authority. Jack spun around, his pulse spiking. Instinctively, he pulled out his AirPods, suddenly aware of a thin sheen of sweat forming across his forehead.

"Jack Hale?" A voice, sharp as a blade, sliced through the quiet.

Jack slowly turned, eyes wide. Three figures stood there, each impeccably dressed in black suits, tailored perfectly, their postures rigid as steel rods. Beneath narrow-brimmed hats, their faces were stern, expressionless—eyes piercing, calculating. The man at the front, square-jawed and pale, held Jack's gaze with chilling intensity, while his companions stood silently behind, unmoving, hands concealed beneath their suit jackets.

"Yes?" Jack managed weakly.

"You're coming with us," the man in front stepped forward, holding out a badge just long enough for Jack to glimpse the letters—FBI.

Jack's heart jolted painfully. His throat tightened, mouth dry as dust. "What's going on?"

"We have a few questions," the lead agent said coldly. "About your recent activities online."

"Activities?" Jack's voice cracked, confusion rapidly turning to panic. Had one of his personal projects—side experiments with blockchain code and decentralized apps, something he considered harmless tinkering—triggered something by mistake?

Before he could protest further, his phone buzzed again—this time, urgently, jarringly, a sound much more forceful than the normal text notification. The screen displayed an unknown number. Jack glanced down. The message was stark, brief:

"THEY'RE COMING FOR YOU. RUN."

He hesitated for a split second, heart racing. Then, without thinking, Jack bolted straight toward the large window, shoving it fully open as adrenaline surged through him. He scrambled onto the fire escape outside, feet pounding metal as he raced downward. Behind him, the agents shouted, their footsteps heavy and echoing like thunder as they gave chase.

Jack leaped onto the sidewalk, bursting into the cool evening air, his mind racing. What was he doing? He was a law-abiding citizen running from what seemed to be the FBI. He’d never broken anything more serious than a few traffic laws. Yet instinct told him he had no choice.

Just as he stumbled onto Alameda Street, headlights blinded him momentarily. A black van screeched to a stop beside him. The door slid open, revealing another figure, equally imposing.

"Get in," the voice ordered, thick with a Russian accent, leaving no room for argument.

Jack froze, heartbeat pounding in his ears. Behind him, the agents rounded the corner. He had seconds to decide who he feared most.
